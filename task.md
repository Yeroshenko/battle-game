Topic: Development of an interactive "Battle" application using React, MUI, and TypeScript.

Objective: Create a React application that showcases your skills in working with the MUI (Material-UI) library and TypeScript.

Tasks:

Application Interface: Develop the main interface of the application using MUI. The interface should be clean, modern, and user-friendly.

"Start Battle" Button: The main screen of the application should feature a button labeled "Start Battle". Pressing this button should initiate the battle process.

Battle Animation: After the button is pressed, a battle animation should appear on the screen. Use a pre-made animation from Lottie (link to animation: Fighting Swords Animation). The animation should play for 10 seconds.

Battle Outcome: After 10 seconds, the animation should stop, and the outcome of the battle - "Victory" or "Defeat" - should be displayed. The result is chosen randomly.

Technical Requirements:

Use TypeScript for typing components and functions.
Use MUI (Material-UI) for styling.
The project structure should be clear and modular.
The code should be clean, efficient, and well-documented.
Submission:

The result should be presented as a link to a GitHub repository containing your project.
Ensure that the README file clearly describes instructions for setting up and running the project.
Evaluation:
Your work will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Adherence to the functional requirements.
Quality and structure of the code.
Visual design and user interface.
Use of TypeScript and MUI.
